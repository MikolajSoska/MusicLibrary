# MusicLibrary
Project for Web Techniques course in Jagiellonian University. This application is a simple library for music CDs. Data are stored in MySQL database. Database schema with sample data can be found in 'db.sql' file.

Written with Node.js using Express.js framework. For view templates, I used Pug engine. Application also uses Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.
